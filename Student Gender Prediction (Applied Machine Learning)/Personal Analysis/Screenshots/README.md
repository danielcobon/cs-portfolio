Screenshots showing results (both in percentage and graph format) of applying Logistic Regression Algorithm to predict student gender (Male/Female) according to their math, reading and writing score, as well as whether they took a test preperation course. Different training–testing data splits were used to evaluate model performance.

Note:
The graph showing the predicted gender of a student if they take a test preperation course is flat, indicating that this variable has little to no predictive influence on a student's gender classification.
