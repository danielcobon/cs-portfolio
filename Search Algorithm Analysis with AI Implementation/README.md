Demonstrates the implementation of search algorithms, A-star (A*), Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to complete and maze, doing a comparative analysis of three search algorithms, based on performance and efficiency.

Language: Python
IDE: Spyder

Includes:
- A report evaluating the use of AI in recent years
- A comparative analysis report that further details the implementation of each search algorithm
- Python implementation of A* maze search algorithm
- Python implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) for maze traversal
- Python implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) for maze traversal
- Video walkthrough/demo of how the program runs
- Images of the results achieved by search algorithms
