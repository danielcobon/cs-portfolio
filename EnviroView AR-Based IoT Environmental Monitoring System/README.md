Demonstrates a novel way to visualize a dynamic environment monitoring system created by implementing an IoT system with Augmented Reality (AR). The resulting AR-IoT Monitor can be used in areas such as gardens.

Includes:
- Arduino & CSharp Code: Arduino source code handling the microcontroller logic for sensor data acquisition and data transmission, along with the C# script responsible for the AR-based visualization for the Unity-Android application.
- AR-IoT Monitor: Relevant directories and files for the Unity-based AR application used for real-time visualization of environmental data.
- Documentation: Project report and user guide detailing system components, architecture, setup instructions and notable application features.
